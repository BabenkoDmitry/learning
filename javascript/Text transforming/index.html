     <h1>Retrieving a specific string character</h1>
     <p>On a related note, you can return any character inside a string by using square bracket notation — this means you include square brackets ([]) on the end of your variable name. Inside the square brackets you include the number of the character you want to return, so for example to retrieve the first letter you'd do this.</p>

   <div class="secondColumn">
     <h1>Changing case</h1>
     <br>
     <br>
     <p>The string methods toLowerCase() and toUpperCase() take a string and convert all the characters to lower or upper case, respectively. This can be useful for example if you want to normalize all user-entered data before storing it in a database.</p>

     <h1>Active learning examples</h1>
     <p>In this section we'll get you to try your handing at writing some string manipulation code. In each exercise below, we have an array of strings, and a loop that processes each value in the array and displays it in a bulleted list. You don't need to understand arrays or loops right now — these will be explained in future articles. All you need to do in each case is write the code that will output the strings in the format that we want them in.</p>
